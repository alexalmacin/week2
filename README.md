Unit 5
images are added to a website using the <img> element.
images need 4 attributes:
- src
- alt
- height
- width
4 types of image formats:
  - PNG (works well when you need transparency in a photograph.)
  - JPG (popular choice for compressing photographs)
  - SVG (perfect for logos, icons, and other types of illustrations)
  - GIF (compresses illustrations)
